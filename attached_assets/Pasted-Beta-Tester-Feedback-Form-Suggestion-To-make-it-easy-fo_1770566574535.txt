Beta Tester Feedback Form Suggestion
To make it easy for your beta testers to report issues in your budget/finance app, I recommend creating a simple web-based form that can be linked directly from the app (e.g., via a "Report Bug" button). This way, when a tester encounters an error, they can click the link, which could pre-populate some fields like the timestamp and error code (if your app can pass them as URL parameters). Tools like Google Forms, Typeform, or Jotform are great for this—they're free for basics, handle file uploads for screenshots, and can email you submissions instantly.
If you want to build it custom (e.g., with HTML/CSS/JS and integrate with your backend), that's fine too, but starting with a no-code tool keeps it quick. I'll outline a sample form structure below, including key fields and why they're useful. You can copy-paste this into Google Forms or similar.
Form Title: "Beta Tester Bug Report for [Your App Name]"
Description at the top:
"Thank you for beta testing our budget/finance app! Please use this form to report any errors or issues. Include as much detail as possible so we can fix it quickly. If you're reporting from the app, the timestamp and error details may auto-fill."
Form Fields:

Tester's Name or Email (Required)
Type: Short text or email input
Purpose: To identify the tester (cross-reference with your signup list) and contact them if needed for follow-up.
Example: Pre-fill if possible from app user data.

Device and App Version (Required)
Type: Short text or dropdown (e.g., iOS/Android/Web, version number)
Purpose: Helps reproduce the issue on specific platforms/versions.
Example: "iOS 17, App v1.0.3"

Timestamp of Error (Auto-filled if possible, otherwise required)
Type: Date/time picker or short text
Purpose: Matches your production logs for debugging.
Tip: In the app, capture the current time (e.g., via JavaScript or app code) and pass it as a URL parameter to pre-fill this (e.g., form-link.com?timestamp=2026-02-08T09:01:00). If manual, instruct: "Enter the approximate time the error occurred."

Error Message or Code (Optional but encouraged)
Type: Short text
Purpose: Direct quote of any error popup or console message to pinpoint the issue.
Tip: If your app logs errors, auto-capture and pre-fill via URL param (e.g., ?error=ERR_BUDGET_CALC_404).

What were you doing when the error happened? (Required)
Type: Long text (paragraph)
Purpose: Narrative of steps leading to the error, e.g., "I was adding a new expense category, entered $50 for groceries, and clicked save."
This recreates the scenario for debugging.

Screenshot or Image Upload (Optional but highly recommended)
Type: File upload (accept images like PNG/JPG)
Purpose: Visual proof of the error screen, UI glitch, or unexpected behavior.
Tip: Instruct: "Screenshot the error and upload here. On mobile, take a screen grab before opening this form."

Additional Comments (Optional)
Type: Long text
Purpose: Any extra details, like how often it happens or suggestions for improvement.

Submit Button
On submission: Send an email notification to you with all details, including attachments.


Implementation Tips:

Signup Integration: When beta testers sign up (via a separate form or email), send them the app download link and this bug report form link. In the app, add a floating button or menu item that says "Report Issue" and opens the form in a browser or webview.
Auto-Capture in App: If your app is web-based, use JavaScript to grab timestamp/error on click. For mobile (e.g., React Native/Flutter), use libraries like Sentry or custom logging to pre-populate.
Privacy Note: Add a footer: "Your data will only be used for debugging and improving the app. We respect your privacy."
Testing the Form: Create a draft in Google Forms (free), share the link with yourself, and test submissions. It auto-saves responses in a Google Sheet for easy review.
Alternatives if Needed: If you want analytics, use Typeform (prettier UI) or integrate with tools like Airtable for database storage. For advanced logging, consider embedding tools like Bugfender or Firebase Crashlytics, but that might be overkill for beta.

This setup should capture everything you need—narrative, screenshot, time/error—for quick log reviews and fixes. If you provide more details about your app's tech stack (e.g., web/mobile), I can refine this further!
