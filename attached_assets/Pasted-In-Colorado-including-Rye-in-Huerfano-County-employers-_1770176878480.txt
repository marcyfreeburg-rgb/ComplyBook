In Colorado (including Rye in Huerfano County), employers are required by state law to provide employees with an itemized pay statement (commonly called a pay stub or paycheck stub) at the time of each wage payment (or at least monthly). This comes from the Colorado Wage Act (Colorado Revised Statutes §8-4-103) and related rules from the Colorado Department of Labor and Employment (Division of Labor Standards and Statistics, 7 CCR 1103-7).
Federal law under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) does not require providing pay stubs to employees, but it does require accurate record-keeping of hours, wages, and other details — so pay stubs help satisfy those records and are standard practice nationwide.
There is no specific mandated "form" or official template from the state or federal government — no required layout, design, or official form number like a W-4. Employers have flexibility in format (paper, electronic/digital, or via payroll software), as long as the required information is clearly itemized, accurate, and provided to the employee.
Required Information on a Colorado Pay Stub
Colorado law requires the pay statement to include at least these key elements (itemized where applicable):

Employee's name (or Social Security Number / last 4 digits of SSN in some interpretations for identification).
Employer's name and address.
Inclusive dates of the pay period (start and end dates).
Gross wages earned (total earnings before deductions, including regular pay, overtime, bonuses, commissions, etc.).
All withholdings and deductions (itemized separately), including:
Federal income tax.
State income tax (Colorado flat rate).
FICA taxes (Social Security 6.2% + Medicare 1.45%).
Any other deductions (e.g., health insurance premiums, retirement contributions, garnishments, voluntary items).

Net wages (take-home pay after all deductions).
Hours worked (especially important for hourly/non-exempt employees; include regular hours and overtime hours separately if applicable).

Many pay stubs also include helpful (but not strictly required) extras for clarity and compliance:

Pay date.
Pay frequency (e.g., bi-weekly, monthly).
Year-to-date (YTD) totals for gross pay, taxes, deductions, and net pay (useful for tax season and W-2 preparation).
Hourly rate (for hourly employees).
Any additional state-specific items (e.g., FAMLI contributions if applicable).

Recommended Structure / Format
A typical, compliant pay stub follows this logical layout (often divided into sections):

Header / Identifying Info
Employer name, address, EIN (optional but common).
Employee name, address, SSN (full or last 4 digits).
Pay period dates, pay date, check/direct deposit number.

Earnings Section
Hours worked (regular + overtime if applicable).
Rate of pay.
Gross pay breakdown (regular, overtime, bonuses, etc.).
Total gross wages.

Deductions / Withholdings Section
Itemized list: Federal tax, Colorado state tax, Social Security, Medicare, other deductions (with descriptions).
Total deductions.

Net Pay
Amount paid (net wages).

Year-to-Date (YTD) Summary (very common and recommended)
Cumulative totals for the year.


Many payroll providers (e.g., ADP, QuickBooks, Gusto, Paychex) generate stubs in this format automatically and ensure compliance. If you're doing payroll manually or with simple software, free or low-cost templates from sites like SecurePayStubs, Patriot Software, or Smartsheet can be customized to meet Colorado requirements.
Additional Notes

Electronic Delivery — Allowed if employees have access and can print/view them easily (many employers use email or portals).
Record Retention — Keep copies (or electronic equivalents) for at least 3 years (Colorado requirement) or 4 years (federal IRS/FLSA recommendation).
Non-Compliance Risks — Failure to provide itemized statements can lead to complaints to the Colorado Department of Labor, potential fines, or wage claims.

For your small/non-profit or consulting setup in Rye, using a standard payroll service is the easiest way to stay compliant without creating a custom form from scratch. If you share more details (e.g., hourly vs. salaried employees, or if you're using specific software), I can suggest exact templates or refinements!
