Top Priorities (Implement These First – They Deliver the Most "Wow" and Trust)

Variance & Status Indicators — This is indeed the #1 missing piece right now.
Show Planned, Actual, Variance ($ and %) for every line item (and totals).
Add color-coded badges:
🟢 On Track
🟡 Caution / At Risk (e.g., 75–90% used or variance > certain threshold)
🔴 Over / Critical (over budget or accelerating too fast)
This shifts the page from "what happened" to "are we safe?" — huge for any buyer doing audits, grants, or internal reviews.

Time-Phased Awareness / Burn Rate
Critical for monthly/periodic budgets like this February 2026 test one.
Calculate and display:
"Expected spend to date" (pro-rated by days elapsed in the period)
"Actual spend to date"
Status: Ahead / On pace / Behind / Accelerating
Simple burn rate: "$X per day average" or "% of period used vs % of budget used"
This prevents surprise overspends late in the month and is essential for restricted/time-bound funds.

Executive Summary Header
Add this right at the top (before the list of budgets/items):
Total Budget: $XX
Total Spent: $YY
Remaining: $ZZ
% Used: NN%
Days Remaining in Period
Projected End-of-Period (simple linear forecast based on current burn)
This makes the page instantly useful for quick glances — CFO/execs/board scan this first.

AI Suggestions Transparency + Forecasting
Expand the "AI Budget Suggestions" section with:
Brief explanation popover: "Based on your last 6 months of spending patterns, excluding one-offs, factoring in seasonality where detected."
Add a forecast line per item or overall: "At current pace, projected to end at $X (Y% over/under budget)"
This builds trust in the AI and turns suggestions into actionable warnings.


Strong Next Tier (High Value, Medium Effort)

Budget Assignment / Context
Let users tag budgets/items to: Grant, Program, Contract, Department, Fund, etc.
Even if backend is still category-based, the label/UI should feel purpose-driven ("This line is for Grant XYZ – restricted").
This screams "compliance-ready" and differentiates from generic tools.
Alerts & Protective Controls
Per item or budget:
Notification thresholds (email/Slack/in-app at 50%, 75%, 90%)
Optional hard/soft stops (prevent spend beyond limit, or just warn)
Market it as "proactive protection against overspend" — sells itself for risk-averse buyers.

Drill-Down & Interactivity
Click progress bar → show linked transactions/actuals
Inline editing for amounts (with approval/lock flow)
Notes/audit trail field per item (auditors live for this)
"Lock" icon for approved/finalized budgets


Nice-to-Haves / Polish (Add Later for Extra Differentiation)

Quick filters/search on the budget list (by name, date, status)
Multi-budget comparison view (e.g., Feb vs Jan side-by-side)
Export enhancements (CSV is good; add PDF with summary + variances)
Mobile-responsive tweaks if not already (progress bars look great on small screens)
