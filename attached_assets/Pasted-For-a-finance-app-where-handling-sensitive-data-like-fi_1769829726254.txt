For a finance app, where handling sensitive data like financial transactions, user identities, and personal information is common, adopting security frameworks focused on secure software development is crucial. These help integrate security into the code lifecycle, reducing vulnerabilities such as injection attacks, data leaks, or unauthorized access. Since you mentioned NIST 800-53 (which provides comprehensive security controls for systems), here are other relevant frameworks tailored more toward software security and development practices. I've prioritized those applicable to app code, drawing from established standards in fintech and general secure coding.
Key Security Frameworks for Finance App Code
These frameworks emphasize secure design, coding, testing, and maintenance, often aligning with regulatory needs like PCI DSS or GDPR in finance.

NIST Secure Software Development Framework (SSDF) - SP 800-218: This is a set of best practices for mitigating software vulnerabilities throughout the development lifecycle (SDLC). It includes preparing the organization (e.g., defining security requirements), protecting software (e.g., secure coding and tool usage), producing well-secured software (e.g., vulnerability scanning), and responding to vulnerabilities. It's highly relevant for finance apps as it maps to executive orders and integrates with DevSecOps, helping prevent issues like those in supply chain attacks.
OWASP Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS): A checklist-based framework for verifying the security of applications, with levels (1-3) of rigor. Level 1 is basic, while Level 3 suits high-risk finance apps (e.g., those handling payments or health data). It covers areas like authentication, access control, cryptography, and error handling in code, making it ideal for web/mobile apps to address top risks like OWASP Top 10.
OWASP Software Assurance Maturity Model (SAMM): Focuses on assessing and improving your organization's software security posture. It includes domains like governance, design, implementation, verification, and operations, with maturity levels to benchmark progress. For finance, it's useful for building a culture of secure coding and compliance with standards like ISO 27001. (Note: SAMM is from OWASP, building on sources like BSIMM.)
ISO/IEC 27034 - Application Security: Provides guidelines for integrating security into application development processes, including organizational norms, project management, and secure engineering. It's tailored for high-stakes sectors like finance, ensuring code addresses threats like data breaches and aligns with broader ISO 27001 for information security management.
CIS Controls (Especially Control 16: Application Software Security): From the Center for Internet Security, this includes 18 controls with a focus on app security (Control 16 covers secure development, testing, and deployment). It's practical for finance apps, emphasizing safeguards like code reviews, dependency management, and runtime protection to meet compliance in regulated environments.
PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard): If your app processes payments (common in finance), this is essential for code security. It requires secure coding practices (e.g., Requirement 6: Develop and maintain secure systems), including regular vulnerability scans, secure authentication, and encryption in code to protect cardholder data.

Additional Considerations for Implementation

Integration with Finance-Specific Compliance: Combine these with broader frameworks like NIST CSF for overall cybersecurity posture or FFIEC guidelines for financial institutions, which emphasize risk assessments in app development.
Best Practices: Start with threat modeling (e.g., using STRIDE), automate security testing (SAST/DAST tools), and train developers on secure coding. For a finance app, prioritize data encryption, API security (e.g., OAuth), and continuous monitoring to handle risks like misconfigurations.
Choosing the Right One: Assess your app's scope—if it's web-based, lean on OWASP; for general SDLC, use NIST SSDF. Many overlap, so map them to your needs (e.g., SSDF integrates with 800-53).
