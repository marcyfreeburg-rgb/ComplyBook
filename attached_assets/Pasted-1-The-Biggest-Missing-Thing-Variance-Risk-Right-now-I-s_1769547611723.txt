1. The Biggest Missing Thing: Variance & Risk

Right now I see:

$0.00 / $7.00 — 0% used

That’s accounting data.
What buyers want is decision data.

🔥 Add: Variance Columns (or Badges)

For each budget item, add:

Planned

Actual

Variance ($ and %)

Status badge

Example:

🟢 On Track

🟡 At Risk (≥75%)

🔴 Over Budget

This instantly turns the page into:

“Can I get in trouble?”

Which is exactly what compliance buyers care about.

2. Add Time Awareness (This Is Critical)

Your budget knows:

Start date

End date

But the UI doesn’t use that intelligence yet.

🔥 Add: “Should vs Actual by Date”

For each item:

“You should have spent: $X by today”

“You have spent: $Y”

Then show:

Ahead of schedule

Behind schedule

Over-accelerating

This is huge for:

Grants

Government contracts

Restricted funds

And it’s a massive differentiator.

3. Budget Alerts & Controls (Compliance Gold)

Right now budgets are passive.

They should be protective.

🔥 Add Budget Alerts

Per budget or per line item:

Alert at 50%

Alert at 75%

Alert at 90%

Hard stop (optional)

Surface this as:

“This budget will alert you before you overspend.”

That language sells itself.

4. Tie Budgets to Things, Not Just Categories

This is where ComplyBook can pull ahead.

Add budget assignment options:

Fund

Grant

Program

Contract

Department

Even if technically it’s still category-based underneath, the UI should say:

“This budget applies to Grant XYZ”

This is nonprofit + gov-ready behavior.

5. Add a Budget Summary Header (Exec View)

Right now the page jumps straight into details.

Add a summary strip at the top:

Total Budget

Total Spent

Remaining

Days Remaining

Burn Rate

This turns the page from:

“Accounting screen”

Into:

“Executive dashboard”

PE buyers and CFOs love this.

6. Forecasting: You’re Almost There

You already have:

AI Budget Suggestions

Now finish the story.

🔥 Add:

“Projected end-of-period spend”

“On track / Over / Under forecast”

Even a simple line like:

“At current spend, you will exceed this budget by $312.”

That sentence alone justifies higher pricing.

7. Explain the AI (Trust Issue)

“AI Budget Suggestions” is cool — but vague.

Add a small helper text or modal:

“Based on last 6 months”

“Excludes one-time expenses”

“Uses seasonality where available”

Compliance buyers are skeptical of black boxes.
Transparency = trust.

8. Tiny UX Wins That Add Polish

These are small, but powerful:

Inline edit for budget amounts

Click progress bar → drill into transactions

Lock icon for “Approved Budget”

Notes field per budget item (auditors LOVE notes)

9. One Strategic Question You Should Answer Here

Right now this page answers:

“What did we plan?”

It should also answer:

“Are we safe?”

Every addition I suggested pushes toward that.
