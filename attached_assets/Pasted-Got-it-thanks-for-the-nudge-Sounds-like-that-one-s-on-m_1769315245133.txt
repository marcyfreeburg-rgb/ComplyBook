Got it — thanks for the nudge. Sounds like that one’s on my side, not yours. Web access can be annoyingly inconsistent depending on routing, cache, or redirects, so I won’t push back on that. If Grok saw it and you’re seeing it, I’m good assuming the site is live and correct 👍

Rather than re-litigate access, let’s do something useful.

Based on what you shared and assuming the site reflects that pricing/features, here’s the straight, founder-to-founder take:

The real question now isn’t “is this good?”

It’s “does the site clearly communicate why this is different and worth paying for?”

Your product is not:

Another bookkeeping app

Another nonprofit CRM

Another QuickBooks add-on

It’s a compliance-grade financial system that spans:

Nonprofits

Government grants

DCAA contractors

Payroll + reporting + audits

That’s rare — but it’s also easy for visitors to miss unless the messaging is ruthless.

What I’d sanity-check on the live site (high impact)
1. Above-the-fold clarity (10-second test)

A stranger should immediately understand:

Who it’s for + what pain it removes

Something like (example, not prescriptive):

Financial management built for nonprofits, grants, and government compliance — without stitching together five tools.

If the hero section leans too generic (“all-in-one,” “streamlined,” etc.), you’re underselling.

2. Pricing page: anchor on replacement cost

Your pricing is reasonable — but buyers don’t evaluate it in a vacuum.

You want them subconsciously comparing this to:

QuickBooks

Aplos / Blackbaud

Grant tracking spreadsheets

Payroll software

Compliance consultants

If the pricing page doesn’t implicitly say:

“This replaces multiple systems”

…you’ll get hesitation at checkout.

A single line like:

Replace accounting, grant tracking, compliance reporting, and donor systems with one platform

can materially increase conversion.

3. Professional tier = compliance hero

This tier should scream:

“Audit-ready”

“Grant-ready”

“Government-ready”

Even one bold callout helps:

Designed for federal reporting, audits, and restricted funds

Right now (based on your written pricing), the value is there — it just needs louder framing.

4. Trust signals (you’ve earned them — use them)

You already have:

NIST 800-53

ASVS Level 2

Immutable audit logs

SF-425 / Form 990

If those aren’t visually surfaced (icons, badges, short callouts), that’s a missed opportunity. These are buyer-calming features, especially for CFOs and EDs.

One very practical next step

If you want, paste just one of these here:

Homepage hero + subhead

Pricing page copy

“Who it’s for” section

I’ll give you line-level edits, not vibes — focused on conversion, not marketing fluff.

You’ve clearly built something real.
Now it’s about making sure the site tells that story instantly.
