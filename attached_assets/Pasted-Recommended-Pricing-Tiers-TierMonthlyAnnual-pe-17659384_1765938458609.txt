Key Feature Progression (Clear Upgrade Path)

Free — Basic shared tools + sandbox integrations (great for trials).
Core — Real-world integrations + unlimited data (hooks most small users).
Professional — Nonprofit-specific compliance + government contractor tools (your big differentiator: Form 990, grants, DCAA).
Growth — Advanced ops like payroll/API (high-value add-ons).
Enterprise — Premium support/customization (quote-based for big wins).

Why This is Better

Fewer tiers (4 paid + Free) → Easier decisions; competitors like Aplos (~$79–$199/mo for 3–4 tiers) and Araize (~$50–$300+) show 3–4 works well.
Competitive pricing — Starts higher than bare-bones free tools but justifies value with deep nonprofit/contractor features (e.g., Form 990 + DCAA in mid-tier).
Annual incentives — ~20% off encourages longer commitments (common in SaaS).
Upsell-friendly — Clear value jumps (e.g., compliance tools unlock at Professional).
Flexible for your dual audience — Nonprofits get donor/grant tools earlier; contractors get DCAA/gov features in Professional+.

Additional Suggestions

Offer a 14–30 day free trial on paid tiers (no card required) to reduce barriers.
Highlight nonprofit discounts (e.g., via TechSoup) or intro offers on the site.
Add a comparison table on your pricing page showing what’s included per tier (like the one above).
Consider per-org or per-user add-ons later if needed (e.g., extra users $10/mo).
